#Multimedior#

The goal of this project was to create a simple boidsystem with a GUI, for tweaking certain parameters.

We decided to use C++ and Qt Quick.

##Building##

###Required software###
* Computer running Linux or Windows (Mac OSX was not tested)
* git
* C++ compiler
* Qt libraries >= 5.1, on Mint/Ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev```
* qmake

##Building instructions##
1. Create a new, empty folder
2. Clone the repository ("git clone https://github.com/knorko/Multimedior.git")
3. Run qmake to generate a makefile
4. Lastly execute make

If everything went well, an executable named 'Multimedior' should have been created.
